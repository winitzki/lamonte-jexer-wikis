TWindow
=======

TWindow is the top-level container and drawing surface for other widgets.

TWindow is a very special class, serving as the fundamental glue
between TWidget and TApplication:

* Events are only routed to widgets that have windows.

* Widgets can only access the TApplication and Screen through their
  parent window.

* Windows can be system-modal: receiving all events and drawn on top
  of all other windows.
