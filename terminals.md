Terminal Features
=================

Jexer can use the following features of a terminal if available:

* Mouse clicks.

* Mouse motion, including dragging and resizing windows, and
  SGR-Pixels mode (1016).
  [DECRQM/DECRPM](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRQM.html) is used
  to detect SGR-Pixels support.

* 24-bit ("true color") RGB.

* Image support via sixel or iTerm2.  (So far as I know, Jexer is the
  first text windowing system with image support.)  There is currently
  [no documented
  means](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/8940) of detecting
  iTerm2 image support, so Jexer will emit iTerm2 images when
  jexer.ECMA48.iTerm2Images=true, or when it detects (via XTVERSION)
  WezTerm, mintty, or iTerm2.  (Note that I cannot easily test iTerm2
  itself; the last time I tried it it did not fare well with either
  sixel or iTerm2 images.)

Terminals
---------

Most popular X11 terminals can run Jexer, but only a few support all
of Jexer's features.  Jexer is actively developed against
[xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) and
[wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) .  The table below lists
the terminals last tested against Jexer:

1 - Requires mouse support from host terminal.

2 - Also fails to filter out sixel data, leaving garbage on screen.

3 - Latest in repository.

3b - Latest in repository, using graphics PR branch.

4 - Requires TERM=xterm-1003 before starting.

5 - Sixel images can crash terminal.

6 - Version 1.4.3243.0, on Windows 10.0.19041.1.  Tested against
    WSL-1 Debian instance.

7 - Both sixel and iTerm2 images.

When running on the raw Linux console,
[LCXterm](https://gitlab.com/klamonte/lcxterm) or
[Qodem](http://qodem.sourceforge.net) are required if one wishes to
use the mouse.  [GPM](https://github.com/telmich/gpm) is also
required.
