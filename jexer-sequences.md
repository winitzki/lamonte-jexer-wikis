Jexer Escape Sequences
======================

Goals
-----

Jexer's primary project goal is to expose the capabilities of stock
xterm to applications.  If a way to achieve its aims exists in xterm's
[defined
sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html),
then Jexer will use that.

Jexer's secondary goals are:

* To provide feature parity between its ECMA48 and Swing backends, so
  that applications can seamlessly be used in either environment.

* To be able to run Jexer-inside-Jexer smoothly.

This document outlines the places where Jexer goes outside xterm's
defined sequences in order to achieve its secondary goals.



Images
------

xterm provides sixel for bitmap images, but does not provide a
non-palettized 24-bit image format.  Jexer's [image
protocol](jexer-images) can be used to transmit basic 24-bit bitmap
images.



Nested Text Mouse Pointer
-------------------------

Running a ECMA8Terminal Jexer application inside a Jexer ECMA48
terminal window creates an issue with the text mouse pointer: both
"host" and "guest" application invert the cell to represent the mouse,
resulting in the mouse being invisible.  Jexer's solution is for
ECMA48Terminal backend to issue a Privacy Message containing the text
"hideMousePointer":

```
ESC ^ hideMousePointer ESC \
```

When ECMA48 terminal (TTerminalWindow) sees this message, it requests
its TApplication to not draw the mouse when that mouse is over the
window.  This results in the "guest" inverting the mouse cell, and all
subsequent hosts not inverting it, such that mouse pointer remains
visible to the end user.

On exit, ECMA48Terminal emits another Privacy Message containing
"showMousePointer":

```
ESC ^ showMousePointer ESC \
```

A non-Jexer terminal should quietly consume these Privacy Messages as
per the [VT320
specification](https://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/appendixe.html).
