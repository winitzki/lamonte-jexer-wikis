Jexer - Java Text User Interface Library
========================================

Jexer is a text-based windowing system loosely reminiscent of Borland's [Turbo Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) system.  Jexer works on both command-line [Xterm-like terminals](terminals) and on X11/Mac/Windows GUI systems using Swing.
