TSPlitPane
==========

TSplitPane is a container for two widgets with a mouse-resizable
divider between them.  The split can be either horizontal or vertical.
Convenience methods are provided to refer to the left and right
widgets in a vertical split, or the top and bottom widgets of a
horizontal split.
