Applications Wishlist
=====================

Jexer is intended to make the hard parts of xterm-like keyboard,
mouse, and screen easy, so that people can build fast, advanced
user-friendly text applications.  Some of those potential applications
are outlined here.

* Integrated Development Environment - [Tranquil
  Java](https://tjide.sourceforge.io) is a Java language IDE in early
  stages of development.  Its interface will feel familiar to those
  who used the Turbo and Borland branded IDEs from the 90's.

* Word Processor - A WordPerfect 5.1 clone would be lovely.

* Spreadsheet - Jexer's TTableWindow is a reasonable starting point
  for a Lotus 1-2-3 clone.

* Text-Based Window Manager - Jexer is a text-based window manager out
  of the box.  But with just a little time one could turn the [tiling
  window manager example](example-tiling-wm) into a true powerhouse.
  Check out [Xterm Window
  Manager](https://gitlab.com/AutumnMeowMeow/xtermwm), it does just
  that.

* File Manager - The [file viewer example](example-image-viewer) could
  be a starting point for a 'ranger' like file manager, but with sixel
  support for images.  Or one could build it into an orthodox
  drag-and-drop file manager like an 'mc' clone.

* Terminal Client - Take Jexer's TTerminalWindow, add a protocol
  library like JSch, and one could have a true cross-platform
  sixel-supporting terminal emulator.

* Web Browser - Between TText, TButton, TField, TEditorWidget, and
  TImage, you have most of the core UI elements needed for a
  mouse-supporting image-displaying text-based web browser.
