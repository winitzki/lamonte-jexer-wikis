Known Issues / Arbitrary Decisions
==================================

Some arbitrary design decisions had to be made when either the
obviously expected behavior did not happen or when a specification was
ambiguous.  This section describes such issues.

- Sixel output on the bottom row (usually the status line) will cause
  xterm to scroll the window.  This affects double / full-width
  characters (such as CJK) and images.

- See jexer.tterminal.ECMA48 for more specifics of terminal emulation
  limitations.

- TTerminalWindow uses cmd.exe on Windows.  Output will not be seen
  until enter is pressed, due to cmd.exe's use of line-oriented input
  (see the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT flag for GetConsoleMode() and
  SetConsoleMode()).

- TTerminalWindow by default launches 'script -fqe /dev/null' or
  'script -q -F /dev/null' on non-Windows platforms.  This is a
  workaround for the C library behavior of checking for a tty: script
  launches $SHELL in a pseudo-tty.  This works on Linux and Mac but
  might not on other Posix-y platforms.

- Closing a TTerminalWindow without exiting the process inside it may
  result in a zombie 'script' process.

- When not using 'ptypipe', closing a TTerminalWindow without exiting
  the process inside it may result in a SIGTERM to the JVM causing it
  to crash.  The root cause is the 'script' utility calling kill(0,
  SIGTERM) (which kills every process in the process group) when it
  receives EPIPE from the JVM process.  Running 'setsid script' is a
  workaround for Linux systems, which can be enabled by setting
  "jexer.TTerminal.setsid" to "true".

- TTerminalWindow can only notify the child process of changes in
  window size if using the 'ptypipe' utility, due to Java's lack of
  support for forkpty() and similar.  ptypipe is available at
  https://gitlab.com/AutumnMeowMeow/ptypipe.

- Java's InputStreamReader as used by the ECMA48 backend requires a
  valid UTF-8 stream.  The default X10 encoding for mouse coordinates
  outside (160,94) can corrupt that stream, at best putting garbage
  keyboard events in the input queue but at worst causing the backend
  reader thread to throw an Exception and exit and make the entire UI
  unusable.  Mouse support therefore requires a terminal that can
  deliver either UTF-8 coordinates (1005 mode) or SGR coordinates
  (1006 mode).  Most modern terminals can do this.

- jexer.session.TTYSession calls 'stty size' once every second to
  check the current window size, performing the same function as
  ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ) but without requiring a native library.

- jexer.backend.ECMA48Terminal calls 'stty' to perform the equivalent
  of cfmakeraw() when using System.in/out.  System.out is also
  (blindly!) put in 'stty sane cooked' mode when exiting.

- jexer.backend.ECMA48Terminal uses a single palette for all sixel
  images.  These colors are generated in the
  SixelPalette.makePalette() method with bits for hue, saturation, and
  luminance, and the two extremes set to pure black and pure white.
  This provides a reasonable general-purpose palette light on CPU, but
  at a cost that individual images do not look as good as the terminal
  is actually capable of.
